To get started and join Cardano testnets, you should install and configure the
Cardano node and the command line interface (CLI), configure your testing
environment, and generate payment keys and addresses. Note, that you will also
need [to get some test ada](/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet) to test your
transactions.

## System requirements

The Cardano node can run on the following platforms:

- Linux Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) or later
- Linux Mint 19.3 (Tricia) or later
- Linux Debian 10.3 (Buster) or later
- MacOSX 10.14.0 (Mojave) or later
- Windows 10.

## Installing the node

Download the latest version of the node:

- [Cardano node releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)

Check your executables. The latest versions of the Cardano node and CLI can be
found here:

- [Cardano node executables](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node#executables)

There are a number of ways to install and run a Cardano node on testnet. The
choice of the best-matching method depends on the operating system, level of
technical expertise, and personal preferences.

For more information on the various options, see:

- [Cardano course: building the node](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course/handbook/module-1-build-and-run-the-node/building-the-node).

## Configurations

To start working with the node, it is essential to ensure that the node
configuration, genesis, and topology files are correctly set up. In addition,
the node will need the configuration files specific to each era that the Cardano
network has experienced thus far.

These configurations tell the node how to handle the updates that come with each
era (ie, Mary, Alonzo, Babbage, etc). Each new era (implemented using the
hard fork combinator technology)
introduces protocol changes and new ledger rules. While old configurations are
still valid, the new configurations and features offer new rules and
improvements. In the Babbage era, for example, Plutus V2 scripts work better
than Plutus V1 scripts. Plutus V1 scripts, however, are still supported.

For more details, see:

- [Cardano course: running the node and connecting to a network](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course/handbook/module-1-build-and-run-the-node/running-the-node-and-connecting-to-a-network).

## Working with the Cardano testnets

Note that mainnet and testnet commands are very similar except for the flag
usage. For example, when interacting with cardano-cli on mainnet, you should add
the `--mainnet` flag. However, to use the same commands on testnets, you should
use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead.

`INTEGER` indicates the number of the testnet:

- Preview integer is `2`
- Pre-production integer is `1`

### Creating keys and addresses

To send and receive transactions, you should first create the payment key pair:

```
cardano-cli address key-gen \
--verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--signing-key-file payment.skey
```

This creates two files: `payment.vkey` (the public verification key) and
`payment.skey` (the private signing key).

Both verification keys (payment.vkey and stake.vkey) are used to build the
address and the resulting payment address is associated with these keys.

To build the address, run:

```
cardano-cli address build \
--payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
--out-file payment.addr \
--testnet-magic INTEGER
```

To query the balance of the address, run:

```
cardano-cli query utxo \
--address $(cat payment.addr) \
--testnet-magic INTEGER
```

For more commands, see:

- [Generating wallet keys](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/generating-wallet-keys)
- [Creating keys and addresses](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course/handbook/building-and-running-the-node/create-keys-and-addresses).

:::note

Note to use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead of `--mainnet`.

### Funding the address using a faucet

To fund your testnet address, go to the testnets faucet and request some test
ada:

- [The testnet faucet](/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet)

If you're working in a _pre-production environment_ and have an API key, you can
run the following command to fund your address:

`curl -X POST -s 'https://faucet.preprod.world.dev.cardano.org/send-money/YOURADDRESS?api_key=YOURAPIKEY'`

### Creating, signing, and submitting transactions

Youâ€™re now ready to create, sign, and submit transactions on testnets. See the
tutorials:

- [Building and signing transactions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/create-simple-transaction)
- [Creating simple transactions](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course/handbook/building-and-running-the-node/create-a-simple-transaction).
