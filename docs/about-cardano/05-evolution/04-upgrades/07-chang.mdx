metaTitle: Chang - on-chain participatory governance
---

The Chang upgrade ushered in the Conway ledger era, a deeply transformative advancement for Cardano's governance, where any ada holder can submit or participate in the voting process for governance actions. The upgrade happened in two stages, Chang #1 and Chang #2, now known as the Plomin hard fork.

Conway, named after the eminent mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), builds upon previous phases, emphasizing decentralized decision-making and enhanced smart contract functionalities.

 In November 2024, following the sudden passing of Matthew Plomin, the hard fork working group recommended to rename the second upgrade after him. As a founding partner of the USDM Stablecoin, Matt was instrumental in the construction and regulatory compliance of groundbreaking financial technologies. The renaming has been widely affirmed by the community in a following governance info action. 

## What does Chang enable?

Chang enables on-chain participatory governance through the implementation of mechanisms outlined in CIP-1694. This upgrade ensures transparency, inclusivity, and resilience of governance in the Cardano ecosystem. The Conway era is based on liquid democracy, which enables individual empowerment through democratic consent by leveraging a voting process with the option of direct and representative voting. Ada holders can vote individually on every governance matter, or delegate their voting power to [delegate representatives (DReps)](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/04/11/introducing-the-concept-of-delegate-representatives-dreps/) they trust in decision making. DReps consolidate the voting influence of numerous ada holders, ensuring that each participant can contribute to the future of Cardano’s development.

With the introduction of [PlutusV3](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/02/12/unlocking-more-opportunities-with-plutus-v3/), Plutus scripts are available for use as part of the governance system, enabling sophisticated voting possibilities like supporting DAOs, for example. Chang also brings advanced Plutus cryptographic primitives, other new primitives, and performance enhancements to the platform. These additions provide developers with a richer smart contract creation toolkit, enhancing both developer and user experiences, and unlocking new possibilities for decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano.

### Chang’s key features

**Decentralized governance mechanisms:** through Chang, Cardano institutes on-chain decentralized governance mechanisms including a constitutional committee (CC), DReps, and a new governance role for stake pool operators (SPOs), fostering community-driven decision-making processes.

**On-chain voting:** Chang facilitates on-chain voting for governance actions, allowing stakeholders to propose and vote on protocol changes and other governance-related matters.

**PlutusV3 ledger language**: [PlutusV3](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/02/12/unlocking-more-opportunities-with-plutus-v3/) introduces advanced Plutus primitives and cryptographic capabilities, enhancing the platform's smart contract functionalities. Cryptographic primitives are central to every blockchain, including hash functions, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems. These elements are designed for computational efficiency, ensuring robust security for their applications. PlutusV3 enhancements include:

- **BLS12-381 primitives.** This collection of new built-in functions is fundamental for cryptographic operations that allow for efficient verification of zero-knowledge proofs.
- **New hash primitives**. Blake2b-224 and [Keccak-256](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-101) are new cryptographic hash functions used for validating transaction signatures (improving compatibility with Ethereum), and secure data verification respectively.
- **Sums of products (SOPs)**. PlutusV3 introduces SOPs, a new approach to encoding data types in Plutus Core. This method improves script efficiency and code generation for Plutus Core compilers, leading to faster program execution and streamlined smart contract development.
- **Bitwise primitives**. The Chang upgrade brings two new bitwise primitives – `integerToByteString` and `byteStringToInteger`. Additional primitives will be added to Plutus V1, V2, and V3 with future upgrades. These primitives offer robust capabilities for low-level bit manipulations. This enhances performance optimization, cryptographic support, integer-string conversions, and efficient algorithms and data structures within smart contracts.

## Additional functionalities 

Conway also introduces several new functionalities:

- Reference scripts are enabled for Plutus V1 scripts. This enables legacy scripts to take advantage of reference scripts, reducing DApp costs and increasing on-chain capacity.
- The `minFeeRefScriptsCoinsPerByte` protocol parameter refines the Plutus cost model and improves fee calculations by allowing separate tuning of the costs for reference scripts.
- Adjustments to SPO deposits: SPO deposits are tracked individually, distinguishing between stake address registration deposits and stake pool registration deposits. This distinction has been retroactively applied all the way back to Shelley, facilitated by the static nature of deposits since their introduction.
- General ledger rules improvements.

## The Chang upgrade in stages

Chang was implemented in two stages. The first stage established foundational governance features, and the second will emphasize community-driven decision-making and governance.

**First stage/bootstrapping**

The first stage was completed in August, 2024. Its purpose is to enable initial governance features and lay the groundwork for Conway-era functionality. During this time, DReps can register, and ada holders can delegate their voting power. PlutusV3 was introduced, which included new governance features.

An [interim constitution](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/interim-cardano-constitution) was established with safeguards supported by a technical guardrails script. An interim constitutional committee oversees the constitutionality of governance actions during the interim period, prior to ratification of a full constitution. The bootstrap period is used to form the group of DReps. Limited governance actions are supported, including parameter changes, hard forks, and 'Info' actions.

During the interim period, only SPOs and the interim constitutional committee can vote on governance actions, including possible protocol parameter changes. As an exception, DReps can participate in 'Info' actions at this stage.

The goal of the first stage is to ensure security and continuity during the governance bootstrapping phase, allowing DReps to register and campaign for delegation, while developing and ratifying a final constitution.

**The second stage/on-chain decision making**  

The second stage, which emphasized decentralized governance, was initiated by the community after the bootstrap period. The governance action to approve this Plomin hard fork was submitted on chain at the end of epoch 529, December 20, 2025 at 21:44 UTC. [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) oversaw, established, and helped facilitate the community in self-government initiatives for the Cardano ecosystem. All governance entities, including DReps, SPOs, and the interim constitutional committee, can vote on governance actions during this stage. The conclusion of this stage allowed for treasury withdrawals.

**The Cardano constitution**

The Cardano Constitutional Convention was held simultaneously in Buenos Aires - Argentina, and Nairobi - Kenya from December 4 to 6, 2024. After 63 workshops across 51 countries, participants came together to refine and strengthen the constitution. The draft constitution was agreed to by 95% of elected delegates. 

The delegate-approved Cardano constitution is the foundational document that translates the community’s values and decisions into a clear set of principles, rules, and responsibilities. It defines the governance framework for the Cardano ecosystem, outlining stakeholders' roles and obligations, including DReps, SPOs, and others. This constitution guides Cardano toward becoming a sustainable platform for Web3 products and services.
